# transmission_finder
Used to find and log transmissions happening on 148.465 MHz. It's a quick-and-dirty tool, hardcoding things like the frequency to monitor, but with some time and modification it can be useful for other projects. See readme.txt for more information on theory of operation and usage instructions.  
  
Written around Python 2.7.13.
